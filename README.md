# Sign language Recongition
This project presents a sign language recognition model trained using transfer learning, specifically focused on the American Sign Language (ASL) dataset. The model has achieved an impressive 85% average accuracy on a standardized evaluation dataset.

Features:
Sign Language Recognition: The model interprets hand gestures to recognize ASL signs.
Transfer Learning: Utilized pretrained models to expedite training and enhance accuracy.
Performance: Demonstrated an average accuracy of 85% across various ASL signs.
Technologies: Developed in Python using TensorFlow/Keras for machine learning, leveraging ASL datasets.
Usage:
Real-time Interpretation: Deploy the model for live interpretation of ASL gestures.
Application Integration: Integrate into applications to assist with communication and accessibility for ASL users.
Future Enhancements:
Fine-tuning: Continuously improve accuracy through fine-tuning and optimization.
Dataset Expansion: Expand the dataset to include more diverse ASL signs and gestures.
Gesture Localization: Implement advanced techniques for precise gesture localization and recognition.
Contribution:
Contributions are welcome! Whether you're interested in enhancing model performance, expanding datasets, or improving usability, your contributions can help advance this tool.
